# BachelorThesis
YOLOv3 model trained for the purpose of autonomous garbage detection. This project was carried out as my bachelor thesis at the HAW Hamburg.
This repository makes use of [AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO](https://github.com/AntonMu/TrainYourOwnYOLO). It only includes the code used for training and performing detection. 

The used dataset can be downloaded from [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1fznAYf0CHPEPs3OAf3gNRbktchRnSuXP/view?usp=sharing) and the produced models from the work of this thesis are available [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1D6ohBVMRIQ35OTQaPL5VOZhzfM9FcakO/view?usp=sharing), by contacting [Prof. JÃ¶rg Dahlkemper](mailto:joerg.dahlkemper@haw-hamburg.de) from the Hamburg University of Applied Science or via contacting [myself](mailto:moazelshebly@outlook.com)
